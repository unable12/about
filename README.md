looking for one person to own iOS.

### founding iOS engineer

Quality | What it means here
--------|-------------------
**SwiftUI fluency** | you've shipped real iOS apps and know the platform deeply
**taste in motion** | you feel when a transition is off, even if the code compiles clean
**speed without breakage** | fast iteration, not reckless -- you balance velocity with stability
**zero-to-one ready** | comfortable owning the foundation without a blueprint
**autonomy** | once the goal is clear, you don't need handholding

### the kind of person who fits

You've likely been the iOS lead on a small team or built an entire app yourself. You've owned complex flows, made tough calls on architecture, and chased down the last 5% that separates decent from great.

You sweat over `.easeInOut` vs `.interpolatingSpring`, know when UIKit's built-in animations fall short, and make SwiftUI transitions feel native. You know the difference between polishing too early and shipping with intention.

You care about polish because you care about people using what you build.
